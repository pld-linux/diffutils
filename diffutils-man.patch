+.Nd compare two files
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm cmp
+.Op Fl l | Fl s
+.Ar file1 file2
+.Op Ar skip1 Op Ar skip2
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+The cmp utility compares two files of any type and writes the results
+to the standard output.
+By default,
+.Nm
+is silent if the files are the same; if they differ, the byte
+and line number at which the first difference occurred is reported.
+.Pp
+Bytes and lines are numbered beginning with one.
+.Pp
+The following options are available:
+.Bl -tag -width flag
+.It Fl l
+Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing
+byte values (octal) for each difference.
+.It Fl s
+Print nothing for differing files; return exit
+status only.
+.El
+.Pp
+The optional arguments
+.Ar skip1
+and 
+.Ar skip2
+are the byte offsets from the beginning of
+.Ar file1
+and
+.Ar file2 ,
+respectively, where the comparison will begin.
+The offset is decimal by default, but may be expressed as an hexadecimal
+or octal value by preceding it with a leading ``0x'' or ``0''.
+.Pp
+The
+.Nm cmp
+utility exits with one of the following values:
+.Bl -tag -width 4n
+.It 0
+The files are identical.
+.It 1
+The files are different; this includes the case
+where one file is identical to the first part of
+the other.
+In the latter case, if the
+.Fl s
+option has not been specified,
+.Nm cmp
+writes to standard output that EOF was reached in the shorter
+file (before any differences were found).
+.It >1
+An error occurred.
+.El
+.Sh SEE ALSO
+.Xr diff 1 ,
+.Xr diff3 1
+.Sh STANDARDS
+The
+.Nm cmp
+utility is expected to be
+.St -p1003.2
+compatible.

+.SH NAME
+diff \- find differences between two files
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B diff
+[options] from-file to-file
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+In the simplest case, 
+.I diff
+compares the contents of the two files
+.I from-file
+and
+.IR to-file .
+A file name of
+.B \-
+stands for
+text read from the standard input.  As a special case,
+.B "diff \- \-"
+compares a copy of standard input to itself.
+
+If 
+.I from-file
+is a directory and
+.I to-file
+is not,
+.I diff
+compares the file in
+.I from-file
+whose file name is that of
+.IR to-file ,
+and vice versa.  The non-directory file must not be
+.BR \- .
+
+If both
+.I from-file
+and
+.I to-file
+are directories,
+.I diff
+compares corresponding files in both directories, in
+alphabetical order; this comparison is not recursive unless the
+.B \-r
+or
+.B \-\-recursive
+option is given.
+.I diff
+never
+compares the actual contents of a directory as if it were a file.  The
+file that is fully specified may not be standard input, because standard
+input is nameless and the notion of ``file with the same name'' does not
+apply.
+
+.B diff
+options begin with
+.BR \- ,
+so normally
+.I from-file
+and
+.I to-file
+may not begin with
+.BR \- .
+However,
+.B \-\-
+as an
+argument by itself treats the remaining arguments as file names even if
+they begin with
+.BR \- .
+.SS Options
+Below is a summary of all of the options that GNU
+.I diff
+accepts.
+Most options have two equivalent names, one of which is a single letter
+preceded by
+.BR \- ,
+and the other of which is a long name preceded by
+.BR \-\- .
+Multiple single letter options (unless they take an
+argument) can be combined into a single command line word:
+.B \-ac
+is
+equivalent to
+.BR "\-a \-c" .
+Long named options can be abbreviated to
+any unique prefix of their name.  Brackets
+.RB ( [
+and
+.BR ] )
+indicate that an
+option takes an optional argument.
+.TP
+.BI \- lines
+Show
+.I lines
+(an integer) lines of context.  This option does not
+specify an output format by itself; it has no effect unless it is
+combined with
+.B \-c
+or
+.BR \-u .
+This option is obsolete.  For proper
+operation,
+.I patch
+typically needs at least two lines of context.

+.SH NAME
+diff3 \- find differences between three files
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B diff3
+[options] mine older yours
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.I diff3
+command compares three files and outputs descriptions
+of their differences.
+
+The files to compare are
+.IR mine ,
+.IR older ,
+and
+.IR yours .
+At most one of these three file names may be
+.BR \- ,
+which tells
+.I diff3
+to read the standard input for that file.
+.SS Options
+Below is a summary of all of the options that GNU
+.I diff3
+accepts.  Multiple single letter options (unless they take an argument)
+can be combined into a single command line argument.
+.TP
+.B \-a
+Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
+do not appear to be text.
+.TP
+.B \-A
+Incorporate all changes from
+.I older
+to
+.I yours
+into
+.IR mine ,
+surrounding all conflicts with bracket lines.
+.TP
+.B \-B
+Old behavior of -A.  Shows non-conflicts.

+.B \-e
+Generate an

+.I older
+to
+.I yours
+into
+.IR mine .
+.TP
+.B \-E
+Like
+.BR \-e ,
+except bracket lines from overlapping changes' first
+and third files.
+With
+.BR \-e ,
+an overlapping change looks like this:
+.sp
+.nf
+<<<<<<< \fImine\fP
+lines from \fImine\fP
+=======
+lines from \fIyours\fP
+>>>>>>> \fIyours\fP
+.fi
+.TP
+.B \-\-ed
+Generate an

+.TP
+.B \-\-easy\-only
+Like
+.BR \-e ,
+except output only the nonoverlapping changes.
+.TP
+.B \-i
+Generate
+.B w
+and
+.B q
+commands at the end of the
+.I ed
+script for System V compatibility.  This option must be combined with
+one of the
+.B \-AeExX3
+options, and may not be combined with
+.BR \-m .
+.TP
+.B \-\-initial\-tab
+Output a tab rather than two spaces before the text of a line in normal format.
+This causes the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.
+.TP
+.BI "\-L " label
+.ns
+.TP
+.BI \-\-label= label
+Use the label
+.I label
+for the brackets output by the
+.BR \-A ,
+.B \-E
+and
+.B \-X
+options.  This option may be given up to three
+times, one for each input file.  The default labels are the names of
+the input files.  Thus
+.B "diff3 \-L X \-L Y \-L Z \-m A B C"
+acts like
+.BR "diff3 \-m A B C ,
+except that the output looks like it came from
+files named
+.BR X ,
+.B Y
+and
+.B Z
+rather than from files
+named
+.BR A ,
+.B B
+and
+.BR C .
+.TP

+.TP
+.B \-\-merge
+Apply the edit script to the first file and send the result to standard
+output.  Unlike piping the output from

+to
+.IR ed ,
+this
+works even for binary files and incomplete lines.
+.B \-A
+is assumed
+if no edit script option is specified.
+.TP
+.B \-\-overlap\-only
+Like

+except output only the overlapping changes.
+.TP
+.B \-\-show\-all
+Incorporate all unmerged changes from

+surrounding all overlapping changes with bracket lines.
+.TP
+.B \-\-show\-overlap
+Like
+.BR \-e ,
+except bracket lines from overlapping changes' first

+.TP
+.B \-T
+Output a tab rather than two spaces before the text of a line in normal format.
+This causes the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.
+.TP
+.B \-\-text
+Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
+do not appear to be text.
+.TP
+.B \-v
+.br

+.TP
+.B \-\-version
+Output the version number of

+.TP
+.B \-X
+Like
+.BR \-E ,

+.SH NAME
+sdiff \- find differences between two files and merge interactively
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B sdiff
+.B -o
+outfile [options] from-file to-file
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.I sdiff
+command merges two files and interactively outputs the
+results to
+.IR outfile .
+
+If
+.I from-file
+is a directory and
+.I to-file
+is not,
+.I sdiff
+compares the file in
+.I from-file
+whose file name is that of
+.IR to-file ,
+and vice versa.
+.I from-file
+and
+.I to-file
+may not both be
+directories.
+
+.I sdiff
+options begin with
+.BR \- ,
+so normally
+.I from-file
+and
+.I to-file
+may not begin with
+.BR \- .
+However,
+.B \-\-
+as an
+argument by itself treats the remaining arguments as file names even if
+they begin with
+.BR \- .
+You may not use
+.B \-
+as an input file.
+
+.I sdiff
+without
+.B \-o
+(or
+.BR \-\-output )
+produces a
+side-by-side difference.  This usage is obsolete; use
+.B "diff \-\-side\-by\-side"
+instead.
+.SS Options
+Below is a summary of all of the options that GNU
+.I sdiff
+accepts.
+Each option has two equivalent names, one of which is a single
+letter preceded by
+.BR \- ,
+and the other of which is a long name
+preceded by
+.BR \-\- .
+Multiple single letter options (unless they take
+an argument) can be combined into a single command line argument.  Long
+named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
+.TP
+.B \-a
+Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
+do not appear to be text.
+.TP
+.B \-b
+Ignore changes in amount of white space.
+.TP
+.B \-B
+Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.
+.TP
+.B \-d
+Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.  This
+makes
+.I sdiff
+slower (sometimes much slower).
+.TP
+.B \-H
+Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that have numerous
+scattered small changes.
+.TP
+.B \-\-expand\-tabs
+Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs
+in the input files.
+.TP
+.B \-i
+Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.
+.TP
+.BI "\-I " regexp
+Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match
+.IR regexp .
+.TP
+.B \-\-ignore\-all\-space
+Ignore white space when comparing lines.
+.TP
+.B \-\-ignore\-blank\-lines
+Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.
+.TP
+.B \-\-ignore\-case
+Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.
+.TP
+.BI \-\-ignore\-matching\-lines= regexp
+Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match
+.IR regexp .
+.TP
+.B \-\-ignore\-space\-change
+Ignore changes in amount of white space.
+.TP
+.B \-l
+.br
+.ns
+.TP
+.B \-\-left\-column
+Print only the left column of two common lines.
+.TP
+.B \-\-minimal
+Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.  This
+makes
+.I sdiff
+slower (sometimes much slower).
+.TP
+.BI "\-o " file
+.br

+.TP
+.BI \-\-output= file
+Put merged output into
+.IR file .
+This option is required for merging.
+.TP
+.B \-s

+.TP
+.B \-\-suppress\-common\-lines
+Do not print common lines.
+.TP
+.B \-\-speed\-large\-files

+.TP
+.B \-t
+Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs

+.B \-\-text
+Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
+do not appear to be text.
+.TP
+.B \-v

+.ns
+.TP
+.B \-\-version
+Output the version number of

+.TP
+.BI "\-w " columns
+.br
+.ns
+.TP
+.BI \-\-width= columns
+Use an output width of
+.IR columns .
+Note that for historical reasons, this option is
+.B \-W
+in
+.IR diff ,
+.B \-w
+in
+.IR sdiff .
+.TP
+.B \-W
+Ignore horizontal white space when comparing lines.
+Note that for historical reasons, this option is
